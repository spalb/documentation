Input of package
===============================

This section will tell you know about input of this package.

Text Files
-------------------------------
Input files of this package is text file (.txt). When you want to use this package You need to prepare a text file in the following format:

 * line 1: number of tasks (n)
 * lines 2 - n+1: task times
 * lines n+2, ‚Ä¶, last line: direct precedence relations in form "i,j"

An example of a properly formatted text file is show below.

Cycle time
-------------------------------
When you run the function, it shows message ‚ÄúEnter the cycle time‚Äù. You must enter the cycle time for the function to be able to solve the problem.

 * lcr, rpw, comsoal, u_ga ü†í Cycle time must larger than maximum processing time
 * parallel_ga ü†í Maximum processing time cann't exceed twice the cycle time

Population size
-------------------------------
Population size only has in u_ga and parallel_ga. It is number of population size in genetic algorithm. It should have a value of 5 or higher. If you don't know what value to use, you can enter ‚Äúd‚Äù to use the default value is 30

Crossover rate
-------------------------------
Crossover rate only has in u_ga and parallel_ga. it is probability to crossover in genetic algorithm. It should have a value of 0 to 1. If you don't know what value to use, you can enter ‚Äúd‚Äù to use the default value is 0.7

Mutation rate
-------------------------------
Mutation rate only has in u_ga and parallel_ga. it is probability to mutation in genetic algorithm. It should have a value of 0 to 1. If you don't know what value to use, you can enter ‚Äúd‚Äù to use the default value is 0.3

Max generation
-------------------------------
Max generation only has in u_ga and parallel_ga. it is number of generation in genetic algorithm. It should have a value of 1 or higher. If you don't know what value to use, you can enter ‚Äúd‚Äù to use the default value is 100
